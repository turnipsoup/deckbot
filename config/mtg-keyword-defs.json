{"attach": "The term attach is used primarily on cards which can provide effects to certain other cards for an indeterminate amount of time, particularly Auras (see enchant), Equipment (see equip), and Fortifications (see fortify).  These types of cards are used by designating something (usually a permanent) for them to be \"attached\" to.\n", "counter": "To counter a spell or ability is to remove it from the stack without resolving its effects, putting it directly into its owner's graveyard.  Some spells and abilities have an additional clause that replaces the graveyard with another game zone.  There are instant spells that will explicitly counter other spells, generally known as \"counterspells\" after the original card with this effect.  Spells and abilities that have one or more targets are also countered by the game rules if they no longer have any legal targets, as would be the case if a targeted creature was returned to its owner's hand or if it gained hexproof.  A spell that is countered this way is said to have been \u2018Countered Upon Resolution\u2019 (formerly \"Fizzled\").  Some cards specify that they \"cannot be countered by spells or abilities\".  This only prevents the explicit method of countering spells; such a spell can still be countered by the game rules.\n", "exile": "To exile a card is to put it into the exile zone, usually as part of a card's effect.  With few exceptions, exiled cards can no longer have an effect on the game.  Starting from the Magic 2010 rules changes, cards that \"remove [something] from the game\" or \"set [something] aside\" were issued errata to say \"exile [something]\" instead.\n", "fight": "When two creatures fight each other, each creature deals damage equal to its power to the other creature.  Multiple creatures may fight each other at the same time.  Fight is a keyword action that has been sporadically printed in some form since the card Gargantuan Gorilla, but it was not keyworded until Innistrad.\n", "mill": "When a player Mills x cards, they put the top x cards of that library into their graveyard. Mill is an action that has been around since Antiquities with Millstone but was never given a keyword until M21.\n", "sacrifice": "To sacrifice a permanent is to put it into its owner's graveyard.  A player can only sacrifice a permanent he or she controls.  Note that this term is separate from other ways permanents can be put into their owners' graveyards, such as destruction (meaning regeneration has no effect on sacrifice) and state-based actions (a creature having 0 toughness, for example).  Players are not allowed to sacrifice unless prompted to by a game effect.\n", "scry": "Scry x allows the player to take the top x cards from their deck, examine them, and place any number of them on the bottom of their deck and the rest on top in any order desired.  Scry originally appeared in Fifth Dawn as a keyword ability, primarily on instants and sorceries as \"Scry 2\", though it was designed to allow other values. Future Sight added values 1 through 4 and redefined scry to be a keyword action, allowing it to be placed in the middle of an ability rather than as a \"tack-on\" to other abilities.  Scry then appeared in Magic 2011, becoming the first mechanic to be revisited in a core set. Scry also returned in Theros block before becoming an evergreen keyword in Magic Origins.\n", "tap/untap": "To tap a permanent is to rotate the card 90 degrees.  This indicates it is being used, often as a cost, or to indicate that a creature is attacking (except for creatures with vigilance).  Creatures a player controls that have not been under his or her control since the beginning of his or her most recent turn are said to have \"summoning sickness\" and cannot be tapped for their abilities that include the \"tap symbol\", nor can they attack, but they can be tapped for costs that use the word \"tap\" (for example, \"Tap two untapped creatures you control\").\n", "deathtouch": "Deathtouch is a static ability that causes a creature to be destroyed as a result of having been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch. In this way, for a creature with deathtouch, any nonzero amount of damage it deals to another creature is considered enough to kill it.  Deathtouch appears mostly on black cards and green cards, and is often thematically associated with poisonous or cursed creatures.  Prior to the introduction of the keyword, similar abilities have appeared mostly on green and black cards, but in most cases those abilities were functionally different (typically triggering on combat damage and/or at end of combat). This ability was first printed on a single timeshifted creature from Future Sight, Thornweald Archer. Older cards with similar or identical abilities, such as Cruel Deceiver, were not changed to gain deathtouch.\n", "defender": "Creatures with defender can't attack.  This ability was formerly associated with creature type Wall which had implicit \"rules baggage\" that prevented attacking.  This was simplified with the keyword, which was first used in the Kamigawa block.\n", "double strike": "A creature with double strike deals both first strike and normal combat damage.[7]  For instance, a creature such as Boros Swiftblade which has 1 power, 2 toughness, and double strike would defeat a creature with 2 power and 1 toughness in combat and survive, unless the latter creature also has first strike or double strike, as the first strike damage would destroy it before it would be able to deal damage.  If the latter creature instead has 2 toughness, both creatures will be destroyed as the opposing creature survived the first strike, after which both creatures would simultaneously deal regular combat damage to each other.  As with first strike, this keyword appears mostly on red and white cards.  It first appeared in Legions and was first used in a Core Set in Tenth Edition.\n", "enchant": "This ability is written Enchant (quality) and appears on Auras, a subtype of enchantment spells.  An Aura enters the battlefield attached to a permanent spell with the quality of its Enchant ability, and can only be attached to a permanent with that quality.  If an Aura is no longer attached to a permanent with the required quality (such as if the object it enchants leaves the battlefield), it is put into its owner's discard pile.  Like protection, the quality can be almost anything, but it normally has a permanent type associated with it, such as \"Enchant creature\".  This ability was formerly seen in the type line instead of \"Enchantment\u00a0\u2014 Aura\"; the wording changed in the Ninth Edition core set, which introduced the Aura subtype.\n", "equip": "This ability is written Equip (cost).  It is found only on Equipment, a subtype of artifact spells that first appeared in Mirrodin.  A player may pay the Equip cost as a sorcery (only during his or her own main phase when the stack is empty) to attach it to a creature he or she controls.  That creature becomes \"equipped\" and can then be referenced by the equipment as the \"equipped creature\".  The controller may pay the Equip cost again to move it to another creature.  When a creature leaves the battlefield or stops being a creature by some effect, any equipment attached to it \"falls off\", becoming unattached but remaining on the battlefield.  Equipment does not \"fall off\" if another player gains control of either the creature or the equipment \u2013 the player who controls the equipment may pay the Equip cost to move it to a creature he or she controls.\n", "first strike": "Creatures with first strike deal damage before other creatures in combat.  Therefore, if a creature with first strike deals sufficient damage to kill an opposing creature without this ability, it will not suffer any combat damage from that creature in return.  First strike is often found on red and white creatures, especially soldiers and knights who carry pikes or lances.\n", "flash": "Flash is the keyword of an ability introduced in Mirage.[8] Artifacts, creatures or enchantments with flash may be played any time their controller could play an instant.  Older cards with that ability have been updated via rules errata to have flash; this allows them to work with cards such as Mystical Teachings.\n", "flying": "Creatures with flying can't be blocked except by other creatures with flying and/or reach.  Flying is the most common keyword, and appears in all five colors, but chiefly in blue and white.  Creatures with flying are often Dragons, Angels, Birds, and other creatures that have wings; flying can also be possessed by some monks and the Djinn.\n", "haste": "Creatures with the haste ability are able to attack and use abilities that involve the tap symbol on the turn a player gains control of them, instead of waiting until their controller's next turn. (An effect dubbed \"summoning sickness\" otherwise prevents a creature from attacking or using abilities with the tap symbol unless its controller controlled it since the start of their most recent turn.)  Haste is an example of a retroactive keywording, as cards from almost every earlier set have possessed \"may attack the turn [they] come into play\" or \"unaffected by summoning sickness\", which was replaced by the word \"haste\".  It was later changed to include untapping to activate abilities as well.  Creatures with haste are most often red.\n", "hexproof": "Hexproof is a static ability of permanents and players.  A player or permanent with hexproof cannot be the target of spells or abilities controlled by an opponent.  This is similar to shroud, but it does not deny the player (or his or her allies) the ability to target his or her own hexproof permanents.  Cards that previously had or granted this ability were updated via rules errata to have hexproof with the release of the Commander decks. The Dominaria set introduced a variant of this keyword, hexproof from (quality), which (similarly to protection) prevents a permanent or player from being targeted by spells and abilities with listed quality.\n", "indestructible": "A permanent with indestructible can't be destroyed by effects that say \"Destroy\" or by lethal damage.  However, they can be countered, exiled, returned to the hand or library, sacrificed, or killed with effects that lower their toughness to zero.  Initially appearing as a quality, indestructible was changed to a keyword so that it can be removed from a card to make it susceptible to being destroyed.  Indestructible first appeared in Darksteel, chiefly among artifacts made of the titular metal, and has appeared in colored creatures in subsequent sets.\n", "lifelink": "Permanents with lifelink cause their controller to gain life whenever they deal damage equal to the amount of damage dealt.  Lifelink as a keyword was introduced in Future Sight, though the ability had previously existed on numerous cards, with rules errata retroactively changing these to lifelink.  Cards with similar abilities were not changed in this way.  Lifelink was a triggered ability when it was issued but is now a static ability due to the Magic 2010 rules changes.  (Cards that previously had a lifelink-like ability have been issued further errata to return them to their original functionality.  The lone exception to this is the Mirrodin card Loxodon Warhammer, which, since it was reprinted in Tenth Edition with the lifelink keyword, retains that rather than the original functionality on all editions).  Lifelink is found mostly on white cards, and also on black cards.\n", "menace": "A creature with menace can only be blocked by two or more creatures.  Menace was instituted as a keyword in Magic Origins, and was retroactively applied to previous cards with that ability.  Menace appears chiefly on black cards and red cards.\n", "protection": "This ability is written as Protection from (quality).  A creature with protection from a quality cannot be enchanted, equipped, blocked, or targeted by anything with that quality, and all damage that would be dealt by a source of that quality is prevented, barring exceptions which explicitly state otherwise.  For example, a creature with protection from red cannot be enchanted by red auras, blocked by red creatures, targeted by red spells and abilities, or take damage from red sources.  A common mnemonic for which effects are prevented by protection is the acronym DEBT, standing for \"Damage, Enchant (or Equip), Block, Target\".  Note that the protection ability does not prevent effects that do not target.\n", "prowess": "Prowess is a triggered ability.  A creature with prowess gains +1/+1 (until end of turn) whenever a noncreature spell is cast by its controller.  If a creature has multiple instances of prowess, each triggers separately.  Prowess was introduced in Khans of Tarkir and became an evergreen keyword with Magic Origins. Prowess appears chiefly on blue cards, and also on red and some white cards. after the release of Hour of Devastation, Prowess is no longer considered Evergreen, and has a Storm scale value of 4, with complications in interactions cited as the cause. As of Core Set 2021, prowess has experienced somewhat of a comeback.\n", "reach": "Reach is a countermeasure to block creatures with flying. creatures with reach can be blocked by non-flyers.  The keyword was introduced in Future Sight, and the flying rules themselves were changed to clarify this interaction.  Older cards with the ability to \"block as though [they] had flying\" were issued rules errata to have reach.  Reach is found primarily in green creatures, especially Spiders.\n", "trample": "An attacking creature with trample which is blocked may deal any excess damage, above what is needed to kill the blocker, directly to the defending player.  The choice is made by the attacking player, as circumstances can arise in which \"overkilling\" the blocking creature is a more advantageous move.  Trample is most often found on green or red creatures.\n", "vigilance": "Vigilance existed as an ability in Limited Edition Alpha, but was retroactively keyworded beginning with the Kamigawa block. Creatures with vigilance do not tap when attacking (prior to being keyworded, these creatures' rules text read \"Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap\"), meaning they can still be used during the opponent's turn to block.   Creatures with vigilance are primarily white and secondarily green.\n", "absorb": "This ability is written Absorb x, where x is a quantity of damage prevented on a creature with the ability.  This ability appears on a single timeshifted creature from Future Sight.  Older cards with this ability were not changed to grant absorb.\n", "adapt": "This ability is written (cost): Adapt x and is a tweaked version of the monstrosity mechanic.  If a creature has no +1/+1 counters on it, you may pay the adapt cost to put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.  In comparison to monstrosity, if a creature somehow loses its +1/+1 counters, it can adapt again and pick up more.  Alternatively, one can place counters in response to the activation to stop the creature from getting N counters.  This mechanic first appears in Ravnica Allegiance and is usually associated with the Simic Combine.\n", "affinity": "This ability is written Affinity for (quality).  A card with affinity costs 1 generic mana less to cast for each permanent with that quality under the caster's control.  For instance, an artifact creature that costs 4 generic mana and has 'Affinity for artifacts', would be free if the player casting it controls four or more artifacts, whereas a sorcery with a printed cost of 4 generic mana and 1 blue mana, will cost a single blue mana regardless of whether its caster controls four or five (or more) artifacts.  Affinity appeared throughout the Mirrodin block, usually for artifacts.  A cycle of five cards in Darksteel had affinity for each of the basic land types.\n", "afterlife": "This ability is written Afterlife x.  When a creature with afterlife dies, its controller creates x 1/1 black and white spirit tokens with flying.  This ability first appears in Ravnica Allegiance and is usually associated with the Orzhov Syndicate.\n", "aftermath": "Aftermath is an ability that appears on instant and sorcery split cards (a card with two separate card images printed on its face next to one another).  Only one of the pair of images contains the aftermath ability.  The half of the pair without the aftermath ability can be cast from the player's hand as normal.  Once the physical card is in the player's graveyard (discard pile), the half of the pair that has the aftermath ability can be cast from the graveyard for the cost printed on the upper right of that card, after which the physical card is exiled.  Functionally, this ability is a hybrid of the kicker and flashback abilities.  As with kicker, cards with aftermath have a primary effect and a secondary optional effect that can be produced by paying an additional cost.  As with flashback, the second effect can be cast from the graveyard at a time of the player's choosing.  Aftermath appears in Amonkhet in all five colors, at rarities of uncommon and above.\n", "amplify": "This ability is written Amplify x.  As a creature with amplify enters the battlefield, its controller may reveal any number of creature cards in his or her hand that share a creature type with the creature . That creature enters the battlefield with x +1/+1 counters on it for each card revealed this way.  Amplify only appears in Legions.\n", "annihilator": "This ability is written Annihilator x.  Whenever a creature with annihilator attacks, the defending player sacrifices x permanents.  Annihilator abilities trigger and resolve during the declare attackers step.  The defending player chooses and sacrifices the required number of permanents before he or she declares blockers.  This is a triggered ability that appears exclusively on colorless Eldrazi cards from Rise of the Eldrazi.\n", "ascend": "Ascend is an ability that checks if the player controls ten or more permanents.  On permanent cards, the check is performed constantly; on instants and sorceries, the check is performed as the spell resolves.  Regardless of source, if the player passes the check, they gain a unique quality called city blessing for the rest of the game, which empowers all cards with ascend in various ways.  This mechanic appears in all colors in Rivals of Ixalan set.\n", "aura swap": "This ability is written Aura swap (cost).  By paying the aura swap cost, the player may exchange the Aura with this ability with an Aura card in his or her hand, if he or she controls and owns the Aura with aura swap.  This ability appears on a single timeshifted Aura from Future Sight.\n", "bands with other": "This ability is a limited version of banding, written as Bands with other (quality).  A creature with this ability has banding, but can only band with creatures that have the same ability; e.g. are of the creature type or sub-type (quality), are of the color (quality), and so on.  Unlike normal banding, in an attacking band only one creature is required to have the bands with other (quality) ability, so long as all other creatures in the band have the specified quality.  All other banding rules apply.\n", "battle cry": "When a creature with battle cry attacks, all other attacking creatures get +1/+0 until the end of the turn.  Battle cry was introduced in Mirrodin Besieged and appears on Mirrodin cards.  A card from the Amonkhet set named Honored Crop-Captain has this ability but it was not printed as battle cry but rather spelled out as if the key word did not exist or had been discontinued.  The oracle text[clarification needed] has also not been changed.[relevant?]\n", "bestow": "This ability is written Bestow (cost) and appears on enchantment creatures.  A creature with bestow gives the player the option to cast it as an Aura that enchants a creature, granting that creature its power, toughness, and abilities.  A bestow card cast for its normal cost will enter the stack as a creature spell.  By choosing to pay the alternative cost, which is a static ability, it becomes an Enchantment-Aura spell; if the creature it targets leaves the battlefield before the bestow card resolves or while the bestow card is enchanting the creature, the bestow card enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature\u00a0\u2013 unlike a regular aura card which would become unattached and go to the graveyard.  This mechanic first appeared on some enchantment creatures from the Theros block.\n", "bolster": "This is a keyword action, written Bolster x.  When a player bolsters, the player chooses one of his creatures with the lowest toughness among them and puts x +1/+1 counters on it.  The bolster effect does not target; the choice of creature is made at the resolution of the spell or ability.  It first appeared in Fate Reforged.\n", "bloodthirst": "This ability is written Bloodthirst x.  A creature with bloodthirst x enters the battlefield with x +1/+1 counters on it if an opponent had been damaged during that turn.  Bloodthirst appears in Guildpact and is the ability associated with the Gruul Clans.  It is the returning mechanic in Magic 2012, where it can be found mostly on black and red cards.\n", "bushido": "This ability is written Bushido x.  When a creature with bushido blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +x/+x until end of turn. Bushido appears on all Samurai in the Kamigawa block, and only on Samurai.  Earlier cards with this ability were not given errata to have bushido.\n", "buyback": "This ability is written Buyback (cost).  It appears on instants and sorceries and is an additional, optional cost when casting the card.  If the buyback cost was paid, the card returns to its owner's hand upon resolving, instead of going to the graveyard.  Buyback first appears in the Tempest block.\n", "cascade": "When a spell with cascade is cast, its controller reveals cards from the top of his or her deck until a non-land card that has a lower converted mana cost is revealed.  That player may then (in addition to the original spell) cast the revealed spell without paying its mana cost; all other revealed cards are put on the bottom of the deck in a random order.  Cascade was introduced in Alara Reborn and is the main feature of the \"Chaos Reigns\" deck from the Planechase 2012 expansion.\n", "champion": "This ability is written Champion a (type).  It is an evolution-style mechanic that mimics a creature changing into a \"new improved version\".[10]  When a creature with champion enters the battlefield, its controller must exile a card he or she controls of the appropriate type, or sacrifice the champion.  When the creature with champion leaves the battlefield, the creature it \"championed\" (the exiled card) is returned to the battlefield.  Most creatures with champion replace a creature that shares their own creature type, but those with the changeling ability have the generic \"Champion a creature\". Champion was introduced in Lorwyn.\n", "changeling": "Changeling is a keyword that gives a card all possible creature types, similar to the ability of Mistform Ultimus.  It appears on certain shapeshifter creatures and tribal spells in Lorwyn.\n", "cipher": "Cipher is printed on sorceries and represents two effects.  When a spell with cipher resolves, its controller may exile the spell \"encoded\" on a creature he or she controls.  Then, whenever that creature deals combat damage to an opponent, its controller can cast a free copy of the encoded spell.  Cipher appears in Gatecrash as the guild keyword of House Dimir.\n", "clash": "Clash is a keyword action that determines the results of a spell or ability. When a card says to clash, its controller chooses an opponent to clash with, and each player involved in the clash reveals the top card of his or her deck, then puts it on the top or bottom of that deck.  The winner of the clash is the player who revealed the card with the highest converted mana cost.  If there is a tie, there is no winner. All cards with clash grant a bonus effect if their controller wins the clash. Clash was introduced in Lorwyn.\n", "conspire": "As a player casts a spell with conspire, he or she may pay the optional, additional cost of tapping two creatures that share a color with the spell.  He or she then copies the spell and may choose new targets for the copy.  Conspire appears on instants and sorceries in Shadowmoor.\n", "convoke": "As a spell with convoke is cast, its controller may tap any number of creatures.  Each creature tapped reduces the card's mana cost by 1 generic mana or 1 mana of the tapped creature's color.  For example, a player may pay for Conclave's Blessing, which costs 3 generic and 1 white mana, by tapping four creatures, at least one of which must be white. Convoke appears in Ravnica: City of Guilds and Guilds of Ravnica and is the ability associated with the Selesnya Conclave. Convoke is also the returning keyword mechanic for the Magic 2015 core set, where it appears in all colors.\n", "crew": "This ability is written as Crew x.  It appears only on vehicles, a new subtype of artifacts introduced during the Kaladesh block.  Vehicles are not creatures by default, but have a power and toughness printed in a different colour. A vehicle's controller can pay the crew cost by tapping any number of creatures with total power greater than or equal to x, which turns the vehicle into an artifact creature until end of turn.\n", "cumulative upkeep": "This ability is written Cumulative upkeep (cost).  At the beginning of each of its controller's upkeeps, an \"age counter\" is put on the card.  The player must then either pay the cumulative upkeep cost for each age counter on the permanent, or sacrifice it.  The ability was originally designed to represent an ever-climbing cost, eventually forcing the player to sacrifice the card and lose its benefits, although later incarnations provide a benefit for the number of age counters on the card. The ability first appeared on the card Cyclone from Arabian Nights, and was first keyworded in Ice Age.  The mechanic also appeared in Mirage block, with Weatherlight offering a number of twists on the upkeep cost, and in Coldsnap.\n", "cycling": "This ability is written Cycling (cost).  A player with a card with cycling in hand may pay the cycling cost, discard the card, and draw a new card.  Cycling cards appeared in the Urza block, the Onslaught block, the Alara block, and the Amonkhet block.  A variant of this keyword is typecycling. Future Sight introduced the first cards with unusual Cycling cost, like discarding a card or paying life.\n", "dash": "This ability is written Dash (cost) on creature spells.  A player casting a card with Dash may opt to pay its Dash cost instead of the normal cost.  If the Dash cost is chosen, the creature gains Haste until the end of turn, and is returned to its owner's hand at the end of turn.  The mechanic first appeared in Fate Reforged.\n", "delve": "When playing a card with delve, its controller may exile any number of cards in his or her graveyard.

This ability first appeared on timeshifted cards from Future Sight, and returned in the set Khans of Tarkir .\n", "detain": "Detain is a keyword action introduced in Return to Ravnica that appears on blue and white cards of the Azorius guild.  When a player detains a permanent, the detained permanent can't attack, block, or activate abilities until the start of the player's next turn.[11]\n", "devour": "This ability is written Devour x.  As a creature with devour enters the battlefield, its controller may sacrifice any number of creatures in order to put x +1/+1 counters on the devouring creature for each creature sacrificed. Devour appears on Jund cards in the Alara block.\n", "dredge": "This ability is written Dredge x.  If a card with dredge is in the player's graveyard, that player may put the top x cards of his or her deck into their graveyard and return the card with dredge to his or her hand, instead of drawing a card from their deck.  A player can't do this if there are fewer than x cards in his or her library.  Dredge appears in Ravnica: City of Guilds and is the ability associated with the Golgari Swarm.\n", "echo": "This ability is written Echo (cost).  Cards with echo require their echo cost to be paid at the beginning of their controller's upkeep, the turn after the card was played or gained control of.  If the echo cost is not paid, then the card is sacrificed.\n", "embalm": "This ability is written Embalm (cost) and appears on creature cards.  When a card with this ability is in a player's graveyard, that player may pay its embalm cost to exile the card and put a token into play that is a zombie copy of the creature, in addition to the creature's other creature types (e.g., a Zombie Angel instead of an Angel).  This allows a player to gain a second use from a card with benefits from other cards that interact with zombie creatures.  Embalm is an activated ability (the token is created, not cast) and may be played only when the player could cast a sorcery.  This keyword is similar to flashback, but is found on creature cards rather than instant and sorcery cards.  Embalm appears in Amonkhet, primarily appears on blue and white cards.  Each card with embalm has its own printed token card, with an alternate artwork showing a mummified version of the original creature.\n", "entwine": "This ability is written Entwine (cost).

Entwine appears in the Mirrodin block.\n", "epic": "Epic has two effects: first, after a player casts a spell with epic, he or she can no longer cast spells for the remainder of the game.  However, at the beginning of each of his or her upkeeps for the rest of the game, the player puts a new copy of the epic spell on the stack.  This doesn't count as \"casting\" it (so it doesn't become a useless ability) and no mana payment is required. Epic appears only on a cycle of five rare sorceries in Saviors of Kamigawa.\n", "evolve": "Evolve is a keyword on creatures which allows them to grow larger.  Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under the player's control, if that creature has larger power or toughness than the creature with evolve, that player can put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.  Evolve was designed by a contestant during The Great Designer Search II and appears in Gatecrash as the guild keyword of the Simic Combine.\n", "evoke": "This ability is written as Evoke (cost) and is an alternate cost for a creature, generally far lower, with the condition that the creature must be sacrificed upon entering the battlefield.  All cards with evoke have additional effects upon entering or leaving the battlefield.  The creature's controller may choose whether the sacrifice occurs before or after the additional effect(s).[12]\nEvoke appears in Lorwyn and Morningtide.\n", "exalted": "Exalted originally appeared on cards within the Bant colors in the Alara block.

When any creature a player controls attacks alone, it receives +1/+1 until end of turn for each permanent with the exalted keyword that player controls.\n", "exert": "Exert is an ability that appears on creature cards.  Depending on the card, a creature with this ability can be exerted to activate its ability, or can be exerted during attack for an additional bonus,[clarification needed] at a cost of that creature not untapping during its controller's next untap step.  Exert appears in both sets of the Amonkhet block, exclusively on green, red, and white cards.\n", "exploit": "Exploit is an ability that appears on creatures.  It gives the player who casts it the option to sacrifice a creature they control when it enters the battlefield, so that a specified ability will trigger.  Exploit appears in Dragons of Tarkir.\n", "explore": "Explore is a keyword action associated with creatures.  When a creature explores, its controller reveals the top card of their deck .

Explore appears in both sets of Ixalan block in all five colors.\n", "extort": "Extort is a keyword which allows a player to slowly drain life from opponent(s).  When casting a spell, the player may pay one white or black mana, then each opponent loses one life and the player gains that much life.[clarification needed]  Extort appeared in Gatecrash as the guild keyword for the Orzhov Syndicate\n", "fabricate": "This creature ability is written as Fabricate x.

At the beginning of its controller's upkeep, a fade counter is removed; if a counter cannot be removed, the card is sacrificed.  Fading is exclusive to Nemesis.  It is extremely similar to the Planar Chaos keyword vanishing.[13]\n", "fateseal": "This keyword action is written Fateseal x.  To fateseal, a player looks at the top x cards of an opponent's deck and may put any number of those cards on the bottom of that player's deck.  Thus, this ability is functionally a scry on the opponent's deck; fateseal was dubbed \"evil scry\" while in design.[14][failed verification] Fateseal exclusively appears on timeshifted cards from Future Sight.\n", "flanking": "When a creature with flanking is blocked by a creature without this ability, the blocking creature gets \u22121/\u22121 until end of turn.  The effect is cumulative; multiple instances of flanking will effect a greater penalty, though a blocking creature only needs one instance to avoid the effect.  Flanking first appears in the Mirage block.\n", "flashback": "This ability is written Flashback (cost) and appears on instants and sorceries.  When a card with this ability is in a player's graveyard, that player may pay its flashback cost and cast the card from the graveyard.  The card is then exiled.  This allows a player to get a second use from a card.

They reappeared in Time Spiral and Innistrad blocks (without the headstone marker).\n", "flip": "Flip is a keyword action that deals with specially printed cards known as \"flip cards\".  Each of these cards has two sets of normal card attributes (e.g. name, rules text, power and toughness): one right-side-up above the card's image and one upside-down (with no mana cost) below the image. Flip cards enter the battlefield unflipped, with only the former set of attributes applying. Once certain conditions are met, the player flips the card (rotating it 180 degrees) and the second set of attributes come into effect.  Once flipped, a card cannot be unflipped (except by leaving the battlefield and returning), and effects that would \"flip\" a card that is already \"flipped\" do nothing. Flip cards appear in the Kamigawa block.  Although \"flipping\" is often colloquially used to refer to morphing and transforming cards, they are distinct mechanics.\n", "forecast": "This ability is written Forecast\u00a0\u2014 Cost: Effect.

Other than attaching to lands instead of creatures, the rules for fortifications are similar to those for equipment.  Fortify appears on a single timeshifted artifact from Future Sight, Darksteel Garrison.\n", "frenzy": "This ability is written Frenzy x.  When a creature with frenzy attacks and is not blocked, it gets + x /+0 until end of turn.

Infect appears on Phyrexian cards in the Scars of Mirrodin block.

Level up appears in Rise of the Eldrazi.\n", "living weapon": "When an equipment with living weapon enters the battlefield, its controller puts a 0/0 black Germ creature token onto the battlefield then attaches that equipment to the token.  All cards with living weapon give the equipped creature a toughness increase to compensate for the Germ's 0 toughness; the player may attach the equipment to a different creature, but the Germ will be instantly sent to the graveyard.  Living weapon was introduced in Mirrodin Besieged and appears on Phyrexian cards.\n", "madness": "This ability is written Madness (cost).  At the time a player discards a card with madness, he or she may pay its madness cost and cast the card. Madness first appeared in Torment, and the rules for madness were subtly shifted for its reappearance in Time Spiral block, where the vast majority of madness cards were black.

The rules for madness were changed again when it was reintroduced for Shadows over Innistrad.\n", "manifest": "This ability is written Manifest [one or more cards], most frequently manifest the top card of your library.  When you manifest a card, you put it onto the battlefield face down.  This disguises its true identity from your opponents.

A card with morph may be cast face-down by paying 3 generic mana. While face-down, the creature is a colorless, nameless and typeless 2/2 creature.  At any time, a player may pay the creature's morph cost and turn the card face-up. Many cards with morph have additional abilities when they are turned face-up. Morph was introduced in the Onslaught block.\n", "multikicker": "Multikicker is a variant of the kicker keyword, written Multikicker (cost), where the cost can be paid any number of times when the card is played, as opposed to the limit of one as defined in the original kicker ability.

It first appeared in Zendikar. In 2009, intimidate was announced as an evergreen keyword to replace fear, though it did not appear in a Core Set until Hideous Visage was printed in Magic 2012.  As with fear, intimidate appeared on predominantly black colors, but did appear on other colors, particularly red.  With Magic Origins, intimidate was phased out and supplanted by menace.[21]\n", "landhome": "This ability is written as (land type)home . A creature with landhome may only attack a player who controls a land of the specified land type, and must be sacrificed if its controller does not control at least one land of that same type.  The ability was present since the Limited Editions of the game, and was first keyworded in Mirage with Kukemssa Serpent . The keyworded ability was only printed on blue cards of the \"islandhome\" variety.  The last card to be printed with a keyworded landhome ability was Manta Ray from Weatherlight.\n", "landwalk": "This ability is written as (Land type)walk.  A creature with this ability can not be blocked while the defending player controls at least one land with the printed land type (e.g. a creature with swampwalk can not be blocked if the opponent has a swamp on the battlefield).  This ability is somewhat rare, with swampwalk and plainswalk being the most and least common, respectively. Landwalk is not limited to the five basic lands; for example, cards with legendary landwalk, snow landwalk, and nonbasic landwalk have been printed. Landwalk was discontinued with Magic Origins.\n", "phasing": "Phasing introduced a new rule to the game.  Cards with the status \"phased out\" are treated as though they do not exist except for cards that specifically interact with phased-out cards.  At the beginning of each player's turn, all permanents the player controls which have phasing become \"phased out\", along with anything attached to the phasing cards. Any cards the player controls which were phased out become \"phased in\" and return to the battlefield at the same time.  Phasing in or out does not tap or untap the permanent. A token that phases out ceases to exist, while anything attached to it phases out and does not phase in on the token's controller's next turn. Phasing appears in the Mirage block.  The earlier cards Oubliette and Tawnos's Coffin were reworded to use phasing as well for a time; however, these errata were removed in 2007.[22]\n", "regenerate": "Regenerate represented two related keyword actions.  An ability such as \"Regenerate [this creature]\" could be activated; in this context \"regenerate\" means \"set up a regeneration shield\", which protects the affected permanent from the next time it would be destroyed (either due to damage or to \"destroy\" effects). Instead of being destroyed, the permanent would become tapped and be removed from combat.  The second keyword action refers to when this actually occurs: cards like Skeleton Scavengers have a delayed triggered ability that only triggers when the creature has a destroy effect prevented by its regeneration ability.  This ability was generally found on creatures, though any permanent can be regenerated.\n", "shroud": "A player or permanent with shroud cannot be the target of spells or abilities (even his or her own).  While the keyword \"shroud\" was introduced in Future Sight, the ability itself existed long before, first appearing on Spectral Cloak; cards which featured this ability were all issued rules errata to have or grant \"shroud\". Creatures with shroud are most often on blue or green cards.  It has been supplanted completely by the more flexible Hexproof.\n", "substance": "Substance was a static ability with no effect which was never printed on a Magic card.  It was originally created for the Magic: The Gathering Online release of Mirage, as a cycle of cards such as Armor of Thorns did not work as originally intended under the rules established with the release of 6th Edition.  These cards were all enchantments that could be played as instants, but only lasted for one turn if played as an instant.  Under the newer rules, the original wording would cause the enchantment to leave the battlefield before damage was removed from creatures.  The creation of substance restored the cards' intended functionality.[25]  With the rule changes announced in July 2009,[26] all cards edited to use this keyword were re-edited to no longer use it.  The official text of such cards now reads: \"If you cast [this card] any time a sorcery couldn't have been cast, the controller of the permanent sacrifices it at the beginning of the next cleanup step.\" This maintained the same functionality as the substance keyword, but without some unintended rules quirks.\n"}
